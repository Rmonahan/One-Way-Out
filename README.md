# Save The Princess

Platform game with an evolving storyline as you go on your journey.

Background 

Save The Princess is a platform inspired game that has the main character going on a journey to save the castle. It features a unique storyline and will require smart movements to obtain the 4 keys that are required to enter the castle and save the princess.

You control Henry who is a coal miner from the kingdom of Tromide. He has always kept a low profile, determined to do his job and then enjoy the peace and quiet of his home. He never made an effort to be known or make friends. No one knew him personally and he liked it that way.  The princess has been kidnapped and all efforts to save her have failed. No one has been able to save her and although Henry has heard of the situation, it wasn't something he was interested in getting involved in. As he was walking to work he saw a flier offering a major reward to anyone that can help save the princess. The one thing Henry does care for is money. This is where his story begins. As you progress through the game you will discover more and more about Henry, the kingdom and the history.
