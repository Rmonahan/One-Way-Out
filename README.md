# Save The Princess

Escape room type game with an evolving storyline as you find your way into the castle to save the princess.

Background 

Save The Princess is an escape room inspired game that has the main character finding his way into the room instead of out. It features a unique storyline and will require creative thinking to come up with the solutions in order to solve the game and figure out the way into the castle.

You control Henry who is a coal miner from the kingdom of Tromide. He has always kept a low profile, determined to do his job and then enjoy the peace and quiet of his home. He never made an effort to be known or make friends. No one knew him personally and he liked it that way.  The princess has been kidnapped and all efforts to save her have failed. No one can figure out the way in and although Henry has heard of the situation, it wasn't something he was interested in getting involved in. As he was walking to work he saw a flier offering a major reward to anyone that can help save the princess. The one thing Henry does care for is money. He thought it over for a while and then after work went home and decided to come up with a plan. This is where his story begins. As you progress through the game you will discover more and more about Henry, the kingdom and the history.
