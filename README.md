# One-Way-Out

Escape room game with an evolving storyline as you find your way out.

Background 

One Way Out is an escape room inspired game with a unique storyline and will require creative thinking to come up with the solutions in order to solve the game and figure out the one way out.
You control Ben who woke up in an unfamiliar place. There appears to be no one else around and it's up to him to figure out how he got there and more importantly how to get out. As you progress through 
the game you will discover more and more about Ben and his story.
